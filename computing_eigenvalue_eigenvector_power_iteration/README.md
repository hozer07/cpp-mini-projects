Computes 2 greatest eigenvalues in absolute value and the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.
Takes inputs at command line in the form "A.txt 0.0001 x.txt", where "A.txt" is the input file that contains input square matrix, 0.0001 is the
tolerance for power iteration and "x.txt" is the file to write the output.
