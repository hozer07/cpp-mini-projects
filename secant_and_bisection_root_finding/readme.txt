Program takes the input at command line.
Example input: 2 2 -7 1 -7 1.5 1.8 0.001
Last number is tolerance. The numbers before the last number are initial guesses(they must be in ascending order) for the result, the root will be in this interval.
The numbers until the last three numbers are the coefficients of the polynomial.
So, the polynomial for this input is (2x^4)+(2x^3)+(-7x^2)+(1x^1)+(-7x^0)=0
