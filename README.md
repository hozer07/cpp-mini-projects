1- Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting

Solves a matrix equation by using Gaussian elimination. Reads the square matrix from "A.txt" and constants from "b.txt".
Solves for x in Ax = b

2- Secant and Bisection Methods for finding a root of a polynomial

Implements these 2 methods to find a root between two initial guesses.

3 - Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors using Normalized Power Iteration together with Deflation

Computes 2 greatest eigenvalues in absolute value and the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. Takes inputs at command line in the form "A.txt 0.0001 x.txt", where "A.txt" is the input file that contains input square matrix, 0.0001 is the tolerance for power iteration and "x.txt" is the file to write the output.
